    Scaling CTX (Defining blocks  dimension)
    Function (Generate RANDOM_Piece)    //  to view any changes use CONSOLe.log()..
        with attributes (shape, color, x,y cordinate ) know as pieceObject
        Declare its object..
    Function (RENDER_PIECE)            // to show piece in the canvas
        To COLOR our element
            ctx.fillstyle =COLORS[pieceObject + color]
            ctx.fillRect =(cordinate, lenght in 2d)
    Function (Movedown)                // to move the  pieceObject down.  increase y cordinate.
    Function (set Interval )           // to   move the piece down in Interval
        Create a funct with pieceObject 
        call RENDER_PIECE // Create obj here.
    //--UNTIL THIS pIECE IS GENERATD --//
    Function (Generate_Grid)
        Create its Variable. // at top

    Check  collison between pieces in func collison
    check if canvas is filled then Alert GAME OVER
        //check with y cordinate in move down
    ADD Functionlity OF ROTATE key..  ***DSA***
